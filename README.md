  </details>
  
- __Colour Palettes__
  
  A **neutral color palette** was chosen to evoke a sense of relaxation in the user as well as to add a natural, cozy look to the site as embroidery often brings a homey feel to people. Nude colors also limit user saturation and eye irritation, which ultimately contribute to a better user experience. 

  A darker blue and reddish colors were used to add contrast to the site to ensure accessibility. 

  The Contact section content was set to white to allow readability.

> [!NOTE]
> To improve accessibility the initial redish colour (#ef525b) used for h5 was replaced with a darker one (#850e14).


- __Imagery__
  
  All images that appear on the website are from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and have been chosen to offer complementary information to the text nearby.
  Imagery colors try to match the colour palette chosen for the overall site design.
