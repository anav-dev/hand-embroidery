- __Colour Palettes__
  
  A **neutral color palette** was chosen to evoke a sense of relaxation in the user as well as to add a natural, cozy look to the site as embroidery often brings a homey feel to people. Nude colors also limit user saturation and eye irritation, which ultimately contribute to a better user experience. 

  A darker blue and reddish colors were used to add contrast to the site to ensure accessibility. 

  The Contact section content was set to white to allow readability.
